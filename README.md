# Computational-Econ
This project I did in this class was in groups and we had to analyze how to incorporate a carbon tax in a consumption-savings model. The tools we used was MatLab to create the code and the graphs of all the variables. Due to this, it was difficult to create parts of the code, which we were able to overcome with the help of our profesor and the rest of the group members.
